    paragraphOne: "Chambers joined the S.T.A.R.S. during a difficult period in the Raccoon Police Department. Since May 20, police have been investigating a series of animal attacks and cannibalistic murders that took place somewhere in Raccoon Forest, but in particular in the Arklay Mountains northwest section of the city.",
    paragraphTwo: "On the night of July 23, 1998, Team Bravo from S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tatics and Rescue Service) is sent to investigate bizarre cases, at first, of cannibalism around Raccoon City, specifically, in the Arklay Mountains. During transport, the helicopter crashes due to an engine failure and the Bravo team ends up investigating the accident site. Rebecca Chambers, a rookie veteran, finds a criminal record of Billy Coen, a former lieutenant who was sentenced to death and was reportedly being transported by a train called the Ecliptic Express. Looking into the forest, Rebecca finds the train stopped.",
