    paragraphOne: "This hulking monstrosity was dropped into Raccoon City amidst the panic of the spreading infection, A gigantic figure shrouded in black and delivered via a heavily reinforced capsule, this new Umbrella-made bioweapon is based on the formidable Tyrant series, iterating to address its few weaknesses.",
    paragraphTwo: "Two vast improvements in particular stand out: its ability to make decisions for itself, determining how best to achieve its goals; and its regeneration abilities, allowing it to continue stalking the battlefield no matter what harm may come its way. Nemesis was given one mission: Exterminate all remaining members of S.T.A.R.S. in Raccoon City. Their knowledge about Umbrella is too great a threat, and must be eliminated. Nemesis has begun stalking its prey and set its sights on its first target: Jill Valentine.",
